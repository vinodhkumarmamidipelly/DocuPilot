# No "Add" Option Needed - SharePoint is Automatic!

## ✅ Good News: You Don't Need to Add Anything!

**SharePoint sites are automatically indexed by Microsoft Search** - there's no "Add" button because it's already included!

---

## 🎯 What You're Seeing

You're on the **"User access"** tab, which is about:
- Managing who can use Copilot
- User permissions
- Billing settings

**This is NOT where you add data sources!**

---

## 🔍 What to Check Instead

### **Option 1: Check "Data access" Tab (Recommended)**

1. **Click the "Data access" tab** (next to "User access")
   - This shows what data sources Copilot can access
   - SharePoint should be listed there automatically

2. **Look for:**
   - SharePoint/OneDrive
   - Your site should be automatically included
   - Status should show "Active" or "Enabled"

---

### **Option 2: Verify Site Settings**

Since SharePoint is auto-indexed, verify at the site level:

1. **Go to your SharePoint site:**
   - `https://onblick.sharepoint.com/sites/DocEnricher-PoC`

2. **Site Settings:**
   - Click gear icon (⚙️) → "Site settings"
   - Find "Search and offline availability"
   - Ensure "Allow this site to appear in search results" = **Yes**

---

### **Option 3: Test Directly in Teams (Best Way!)**

The **easiest way** to verify SharePoint indexing is to test it:

1. **Open Microsoft Teams**
2. **Click "Copilot"** or type `/copilot`
3. **Ask:** "Show me documents in DocEnricher-PoC site"
4. **If documents appear:** ✅ Indexing is working!
5. **If not:** Wait 24-48 hours (for new sites) and try again

## 📊 Understanding the Tabs

### **"User access" Tab (What You're On):**
- Manages who can use Copilot
- User permissions and licensing
- **NOT for adding data sources**

### **"Data access" Tab (What to Check):**
- Shows what data Copilot can access
- SharePoint should be listed automatically
- **This is where you'd see data sources**

### **"Copilot actions" Tab:**
- Manages what Copilot can do
- Actions and capabilities

### **"Other settings" Tab:**
- Additional Copilot configurations

---

## ✅ Why No "Add" Button?

**SharePoint is built-in!**

- ✅ SharePoint sites are **automatically indexed**
- ✅ No manual configuration needed
- ✅ No connector required
- ✅ No "Add" button needed

**The "Connectors" section** (you saw earlier) is for **external services** like:
- ServiceNow
- Salesforce
- Figma
- Other third-party tools

**SharePoint doesn't need a connector** - it's native!
