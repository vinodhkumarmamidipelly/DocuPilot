# SMEPilot - Simple Pitch

## The Problem
Your organization has tons of rough documents with screenshots and minimal descriptions. Employees can't find information when they need it. O365 Copilot can't answer questions about these documents.

## The Solution
SMEPilot automatically:
1. Takes rough documents uploaded to SharePoint
2. Enriches them with AI (adds structure, improves descriptions)
3. Creates professional, indexed documents
4. Makes them searchable via O365 Copilot

**Result**: Employees get instant answers to questions through Teams/Copilot.

### 1. Upload
